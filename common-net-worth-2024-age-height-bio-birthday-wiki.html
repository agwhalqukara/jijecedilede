The album sold relatively well and received a strong positive reaction among alternative and underground hip hop fans at the time. Resurrection was Common Sense’s last album produced almost entirely by his long-time production partner, No I.D., who would later become a mentor to a young Kanye West.</p><h2>Common Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Common is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Common</b>'s net worth <strong>$45 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was a major in business administration in Florida A&M University, where there was a scholarship program for him.</p><p align=justify>He was first given the stage title Common Sense when starting to perform in public.&nbsp;In 2003, he won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song for “Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop).”</p><p align=justify>Corant Lynn was born on March 13, 1972 at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood, the son of educator and former principal of John Hope College Preparatory High School, Mahalia Ann Hines and former ABA basketball player turned youth counselor Lonnie Lynn. He was raised in the Calumet Heights neighborhood. Lynn’s parents divorced when he was six years old, resulting in his father moving to Denver, Colorado. This left Lynn to be raised by his mother; however, his father remained active in his life, and was able to get Lynn a job with the Chicago Bulls as a teenager. Lynn attended Florida A&M University for two years under a scholarship and majored in business administration.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$45 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The song “I Used to Love H.E.R.” from Resurrection ignited a feud with West Coast rap group Westside Connection. The lyrics of the song criticized the path hip hop music was taking, utilizing a metaphor of a woman to convey hip hop and were interpreted by some as directing blame towards the popularity of West Coast gangsta rap. Westside Connection first responded with the 1995 song “Westside Slaughterhouse,” with the lyrics “Used to love H.E.R., mad cause I fucked her”. “Westside Slaughterhouse” also mentioned Common Sense by name, prompting the rapper to respond with the scathing Pete Rock-produced attack song “The Bitch in Yoo”. Common Sense and Westside Connection continued to insult each other back and forth before finally meeting with Louis Farrakhan and setting aside their dispute. Following the popularity of Resurrection, Common Sense was sued by an Orange County-based reggae band with the same name, and was forced to shorten his moniker to simply Common.</p><p>Initially scheduled for an October 1996 release, Common finally released his third album, One Day It’ll All Make Sense, in September 1997. The album took a total of two years to complete and included collaborations with artists such as Lauryn Hill, De La Soul, Q-Tip, Canibus, Black Thought, Chantay Savage, and Questlove – a future fellow member of the Soulquarians outfit. The album, which made a point of eschewing any gangsterism (in response to questions about his musical integrity), was critically acclaimed and led to a major label contract with MCA Records. In addition to releasing One Day, Common’s first child, daughter Omoye Assata Lynn, was born shortly after the release of the album.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Common height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Common <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At another poetry reading, Common said, “flyers say ‘free Mumia’ on my freezer”, a reference to Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was controversially convicted of killing Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981. Common stated, “The one thing that shouldn’t be questioned is my support for the police officers and troops that protect us every day.”</p><p align=justify>Following One Day…, Common signed a major label record deal with MCA Records and relocated from Chicago to New York City in 1999. He began recording almost exclusively with a loose collective of musicians and artists (dubbed the “Soulquarians” by central figure Questlove) throughout 1999, and made a few sporadic guest appearances on The Roots’ Things Fall Apart, and the Rawkus Records compilation, Soundbombing 2.</p><h2>Who is Common Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Common</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
