Here is what we know about them.</span></p><h2><strong>Meet Melvin Booker, Devin Booker’s Father</strong></h2><p>Melvin Booker played college basketball in the United States for the University of Missouri before moving on to a professional career. Although he did not meet the expectations of the game as it is played at the professional level for his country, he was able to provide solid groundwork for the expansion of basketball on the world stage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/835091408430df3c3bb9ef70af443faf.jpg><h3><strong>Melvin Booker Nationality</strong></h3><p>Melvin Booker’s nationality is American. He was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in the United States of America on August 20, 1972, making his current age 51 years old. Melvin’s ethnicity is African American, as is the case with most residents of Mississippi.</p><p>The former basketball player keeps the details of his close relatives a mystery. Although it is logical to assume that he lives a happy life with his parents, this has not been properly established.</p><h3><strong>Melvin Booker Attended the University of Missouri</strong></h3><p>Because he has kept his personal life far from the media, most of his early life activities, including how and where he spent them, are unknown. However, the 1994 Big Eight Player of the Year&nbsp;had his high school education at Moss Point High School in Moss Point, Mississippi.</p><p>After concluding his high school education, Melvin Booker then proceeded to the University of Missouri, Missouri, for his college education from 1990 to 1994. Although he was there on a college scholarship program due to his talent in basketball, what he studied during his college days is unknown.</p><h3><strong>His Basketball Career Took Him To Europe</strong></h3><p>Booker was a high school basketball legend in the Mississippi hamlet of Moss Point, where he competed. He averaged 28 points per game towards the end of his senior year, and his class chose him as their player of the year. Despite this, none of the major four-year universities in the region made him a recruitment offer for the college athlete scholarship program.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/5c7b24fbe2a6c.jpg><p>However, the two-time first-team All-Big Eight of 1993 and 1994 caught the eye of the University of Missouri’s recruiting team during a prior visit to the region. While watching footage of Chris Jackson and Litterial Green, two other exceptional Mississippi players, assistant coaches from Missouri saw him. They asked Booker if he would like to enroll with them. Seeing the opportunity here, Booker agreed. He played for the University of Missouri Tigers basketball team.</p><p>Creating his own destiny, Booker continued to impress and was rewarded soon enough. He received the Big Eight Player of the Year title in 1994 after leading Missouri to a perfect 14-0 record in Big Eight Conference play and a spot in the Elite Eight. He received all-Big Eight recognition in both 1993 and 1994, and as a senior in 1994, he averaged 18.1 points and 4.5 assists per game to earn a spot on the first team of All-Americans.</p><p>In 1999, the University of Missouri recognized Booker when they admitted him to the intercollegiate athletics hall of fame. Despite his numerous successes, Booker was overlooked in the 1994 National Basketball Association Draft selection. He, however still managed to make the NBA. During the 1995–96 season, he played 32 games for the Houston Rockets. The following year, he played 32 games for the Denver Nuggets and the Golden State Warriors, respectively.</p><h3><strong>Does Devin Booker Have a Relationship with His Father?</strong></h3><p><span data-offset-key=6gems-12-0>Yes</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-13-0>,</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-14-0> Devin</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-15-0> Booker</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-16-0> does</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-17-0> have</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-18-0> a</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-19-0> relationship</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-20-0> with</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-21-0> his</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-22-0> father</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-23-0>,</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-24-0> Melvin</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-25-0> Booker</span><span data-offset-key=6gems-26-0>. Melvin has been a positive influence in Devin’s life and a major factor in his decision to pursue a career in basketball. Devin was born when his father had just finished his spell with the NBA and wished to continue his career overseas. </span>Devin did not see his father for the first ten years of his life due to Melvin’s busy schedule abroad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/devin-booker-1-640x536-1.jpg><p>He retired from professional basketball in 2008 and returned to his high school alma mater, where he became a basketball coach in 2011. Melvin encouraged Devin to move to Mississippi to live with him and attend high school with the hopes of helping him grow as a basketball player. The older Booker wanted his son to join him so he could grow as a basketball player and as a young man in Mississippi and learn a better work ethic.</p><p>The consensus second-team All-American of 1994 saw it as an avenue to reconnect and believed that his relationship with his son would grow, too, if he finally had him by his side. It was not an easy decision because Devin did not want to leave his mother, who was living in Michigan. But in the end, he realized it could be the best thing for his future. With his father’s influence, Devin naturally fell in love with basketball as a child.</p><p>Melvin Booker, who had already reached this point in his career, was aware of his son’s challenges and wanted to assist him in being ready to deal with them. And when the Suns selected him in the 2015 NBA draft, he was ready.</p><p>Melvin and Veronica were sitting next to Devin as he was chosen by the Phoenix Suns as the 13th overall choice. On the exterior, Melvin was the picture of calmness, but on the inside, he was overcome by feelings. The family will never forget the events of that June Thursday night.</p><h3><strong>Melvin Booker Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Melvin Booker has an estimated net worth of $5 million. The father of Devin Booker is believed to have made his wealth from his career as a coach and professional basketball player. Melvin’s talents saw him play in the NBA and then in Europe where athletes are handsomely rewarded for their talent. He later returned to the US after retiring to start coaching, a role he played in the life of his son who today is one of the best in the NBA.</p><h2><strong>Meet Veronica Gutierrez, Melvin Booker’s Wife and Devin Booker’s Mom</strong></h2><p>Mellvin Booker’s wife and Devin Booker’s mom is Veronica Gutierrez, an American professional cosmetologist who specializes in hair styling, makeup, and nail care.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><span data-offset-key=1v6k9-56-0>Veronica</span><span data-offset-key=1v6k9-57-0> Gutierrez</span></a> is from<span data-offset-key=1v6k9-59-0> Michigan.

However, going by logic, she seems to be in her late forties. Due to her secretive nature, where and how she spent her early childhood years, and her family members’ identities are unknown. Additionally, the proud mother was unknown until her son became well-known. Thus, the details of her life before Devin’s success are unknown.</p><h3><strong>Veronica Gutierrez’s Nationality</strong></h3><p>Veronica Gutierrez is an American. Though not much about her past has been made public, we know from stories that she has Mexican and Puerto Rican ancestry. According to reports, Veronica Gutierrez was born in Puerto Rico, while her father was a native of Los Nogales, Mexico. But Grand Rapids, Michigan, is supposed to be where she was born.</p><h3><strong>Veronica’s Relationship with Devin Before and After His Fame</strong></h3><p>Devin Booker has a close relationship with his mother, just like he has with his father. He often posts photos of them together on his social media accounts and talks about her frequently in interviews.<span data-offset-key=a7du7-65-0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-offset-key=a7du7-65-0>His</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-66-0> rise</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-67-0> to</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-68-0> st</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-69-0>ard</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-70-0>om</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-71-0> has</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-72-0> been</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-73-0> largely</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-74-0> due</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-75-0> to</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-76-0> his</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-77-0> mother</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-78-0>,</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-79-0> Veronica</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-80-0> Gutierrez</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-81-0>,</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-82-0> who</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-83-0> has</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-84-0> been</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-85-0> a</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-86-0> constant</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-87-0> in</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-88-0> his</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-89-0> life</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-90-0> and</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-91-0> has</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-92-0> been</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-93-0> instrumental</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-94-0> in</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-95-0> helping</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-96-0> him</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-97-0> achieve</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-98-0> his</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-99-0> goals</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-100-0>.</span> <span data-offset-key=a7du7-103-0>Ver</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-104-0>onica</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-105-0> has</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-106-0> been</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-107-0> a</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-108-0> major</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-109-0> influence</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-110-0> in</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-111-0> Devin</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-112-0>’</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-113-0>s</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-114-0> life</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-115-0> since</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-116-0> childhood</span><span data-offset-key=a7du7-120-0>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/745f75b8cdbbd2468de2834c31e90f80.jpg><p><span data-offset-key=a7du7-121-0>Devin remains close to his mother and credits her with much of his success.
