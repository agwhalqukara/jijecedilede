The main protagonist is a high school boy named Shōyō Hinata and his passion for volleyball with big dreams of being a champion. But he is faced with one drawback—his short height.</p><p><strong>The manga began serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump in February 2012 and took 8 years to complete. Based on <a href=# rel=noopener>Crunchyroll</a>—the manga ended on November 4, 2020, with 45 volumes. The anime adaptation presented by Production I.G aired on MBS (Mainichi Broadcasting System) in 2014 and ended in 2020 for a total of 4 seasons.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hinata-Shouyo-Haikyuu-Muhammad-Rouf-Burhan-1024x683.jpg><p>If you are a fan of Haikyuu, read on! No spoilers ahead.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Plot</h2><p>With dreams to be the best volleyball player in school, Hinata strives to beat his rivals despite his lack of stature (being only a little over 5ft 4”).</p><p>But he can jump up to 50 inches and has a competitive spirit to match. His life changes upon meeting Tobio Kageyama “The King of the Court,” who happens to be a middle school volleyball star player who would defeat him and later be the person (and friend!) who would later inspire him to become the ace of their high school’s volleyball team.</p><p>They eventually teamed up at Karasuno High School where they would train to be the best players in Japan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The pair is ranked #9 in the top 10 love-hate relationships in anime by <a href=# rel=noopener>CBR.com</a>. Often squabbling with one another, with no choice but to work together to reach their goals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Season 1</h2><p><strong>Haikyū!! </strong>Season 1 had 25 episodes with episode 1 premiering on April 6, 2014.

TO THE TOP</h2><p>The long-awaited final season had 25 episodes—premiering on January 11, 2020, but got delayed due to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Fans had to wait for the second half, which eventually ran from October 3 to December 19, 2020. Other musical artists that contributed to the soundtrack were SUPER BEAVER with the track “Toppakou” and “Kessen Spirit” by CHiCO with HoneyWorks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Legacy</h2><p>As written on <a href=# rel=noopener>CBR.com</a>, Haikyū!! is number 1 on their list as the Best Anime to Watch with Mom for its wholesome storylines and quirky characters—a must-watch for anyone who loves volleyball (or not).</p><p>The anime was also featured in <a href=# rel=noopener>NHK’s documentary</a> “We Became Strong Through Manga” まんがで強く バレーボール ハイキュー featuring the effects of Haikyū!! on Japanese youth and professional athletes. There was even data showing an increase in men’s high school volleyball clubs with members cheering “I love Hinata!”</p><p>The series’ positive impact was far-reaching, too–<a href=# rel=noopener>a writer based in Australia</a> even wrote a lengthy piece on how it’s helped her cope through the tough year that was 2020.</p><p>No doubt this sports-based anime had a powerful impact on Japanese pop culture—encouraging positivity, sportsmanship, and athletics. The manga won the 61st Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen manga in 2017 with 50 over million copies in circulation.</p><p>Video game adaptations were also released on Nintendo 3DS and Playstation 4.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About Haruichi Furudate</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Looper</a>—the shounen manga creator was born in Iwate Prefecture in Japan and moved to Miyagi where he spent about 10 years there. He went to college at Sendai Design Training School.</p><p>He explained that the places he grew up in deeply influenced the popular volleyball arc. Coincidentally, Haruichi also played volleyball during his high school years and seemed to prioritize sports over academics.</p><p>“I started drawing because I wanted to play volleyball.”—Furudate</p><p>He gained success at the age of 25 upon the release of his first manga “Ousama Kid,” and eventually won honorable mention for the 14th Jump Treasure Newcomer Manga Prize.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Haikyū!! is about one boy’s perseverance to overcome challenges and fulfill one’s destiny in a volleyball-themed arc.
