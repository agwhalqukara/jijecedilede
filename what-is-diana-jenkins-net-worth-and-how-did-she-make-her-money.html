The Bosnia and Herzegovina-born businesswoman and philanthropist is the founder and CEO of Neuro Brands, a lifestyle-drink company.</strong></p><p>We cannot talk about Diana Jenkins’ net worth without mentioning the fact that the bulk of the entrepreneur’s bottom line came from her divorce settlement from Roger Jenkins, whom she was married to for over a decade. However, Diana was already earning handsomely from her jewelry and swimwear business prior to her divorce.</p><p>Diana and Roger’s divorce gave her wings, and she sure soared like an eagle. Today, the former wife of Roger Jenkins has several thriving businesses under her belt, and needless to say, it gets the funds rolling in.</p><h3><strong>Key Info:</strong></h3><p>Net Worth: $300 Million<br>Date of Birth: 1973<br>Place of Birth: Sarajevo<br>Gender: Female<br>Nationality: Bosnia and Herzegovina</p><h2><strong>How Rich is Diana Jenkins?</strong></h2><p>According to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the most recent estimation of Diana Jenkins’ fortune is pegged at $300 million. Diana has not always been rich. In fact, she describes her life journey as a case of “rags to riches.”</p><p>When she first came to Britain, Diana was escaping from her war-ravaged country, Bosnia. The Bosnian native survived the war by the skin of her teeth, and even though she faced a lot of challenges in England, Diana persevered, and her hard work was rewarded with resounding success.</p><h2><strong>How Did Diana Jenkins’ Net Worth Accrue?</strong></h2><p>Diana Jenkins accumulated her wealth from diverse sources. Considering where she was coming from, the Bosnian native said she was more than happy to start earning a living.</p><p>From working as a clerk in Covent Garden, fortune smiled on Diana, and today, she is listed as a reality TV star and a shrewd businesswoman with interest in swimwear, music production, beverages, and real estate.</p><p>Above all, Diana is also credited with having what many would describe as a “brilliant marriage.” The Bosnian-born businesswoman owes the bulk of her wealth to the divorce payout she received from her ex.</p><h3><strong>She First Tried Her Hands at Paid Employment</strong></h3><p>After acquiring her first degree in computer science and economics from the City University London, Diana Jenkins moved into the labor market to make a living for herself. The first job she scored was at a London-based shopping and entertainment hub known as Covent Garden. She spent a few years at the hub working in her capacity as a clerk.</p><p>Jenkins was quite prudent with spending during her days at Covent, and by the time she was ready to go, the aspiring businesswoman had already saved enough funds to float her own jewelry business.</p><h3><strong>She Became a Businesswoman after Launching her Jewelry Business</strong></h3><p>From Clerking, Diana floated her own jewelry store in London, which marked her debut in the wheeling-dealing world of business. Though the details of this particular venture business are not known, reports said it is still in existence and generating income for the Bosnian native.</p><h3><strong>Diana Jenkins Moved From Jewelry to Swimwear Line</strong></h3><p>After her jewelry store proved to be a successful concern, Diana Jenkins got the needed encouragement to break new frontiers. Her next port of call was the swimwear business which led the emerging entrepreneur to partner with the celebrated model Melissa Odabash; the duo established a line of swimwear known as Melissa Odabash swimwear line</p><p>Before long, the swimwear line gained popularity among A-list celebrities such as Kate Moss, Heidi Klum, Elle Macpherson, and many more. With the caliber of people patronizing the line, it was no surprise that it became extremely successful, taking Diana’s financial standing a notch higher. The swimwear line is still thriving, and Jenkins still earns from it to date.</p><h3><strong>Diana Jenkins was Awarded a Huge Alimony Following her Divorce from Ex-spouse, Roger Jenkins</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/OIP-2-e1671565181522.jpg><p>Diana Jenkins’ divorce settlement takes the credit for catapulting the then-emerging businesswoman to the league of the crème de la crème of both the entertainment and business worlds.</p><p>Fortune smiled on Diana during her days at London City University when she ran into British banker Roger Jenkins in a gym adjourning the campus. Roger was then lecturing in the institution of higher learning and later served with Barclays’ Middle Eastern business as its substantial chairman.</p><p>The duo’s 1999 wedding ended in a divorce, which saw Diana receive a whopping £150 million from her ex-husband’s fortune of £300 million; this happened in 2012.</p><p>When quizzed about his feeling about Diana receiving half of his fortune, Roger Jenkins told The Mail on Sunday that his ex-wife deserves whatever she gets from him. Crediting Diana as being a strong force behind his current success, the British banker said he wouldn’t have dreamt of attaining the fame and fortune he enjoys today without her.</p><p>Roger credited his ex with helping in securing the £7.3 billion investment from the Qatari royal family into Barclays. According to Roger, Diana went ahead to cultivate a relationship with Sheik Hamad Al-Thani’s wife; Hamad was Qatar’s former Emir.</p><p>The sudden surge in her bank balance placed the businesswoman woman on the list of the UK’s richest women. Before long, she moved from London to Southern California to put down roots in a 3-acre clifftop property located in Malibu. It was at this point that Diana Jenkins’ really started focusing on bigger businesses as well as philanthropy.</p><h3><strong>Diana Jenkins Owns the Successful Beverage Brand known as Neuro Brands</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/neuro-1024x463-1-e1671565746880.jpg><p>Added to her jewelry and swimwear business, Diana Jenkins takes the credit for founding Neuro Drinks – a lifestyle health drinks company that prides itself on being a healthy alternative to both caffeine and soda.

Diana believes that the devastating educational and medical infrastructures in her country deserve to be rebuilt. In her message, which was published on the website of the foundation, Diana called on the world not to forget her home country, Bosnia. So far, the foundation has fully funded and supported over 100 projects from 2004 to date.</p><p>Apart from her Bosnian foundation, Diana Jenkins has done well in reaching out to her countrymen individually. There was a time that the former VP of Bosnia, Ejup Ganic, was jailed in the UK for war crimes, and the businesswoman wasted no time in providing bail for him. According to Diana, she found all the accusations leveled against Ejup to be false.</p><h3><strong>Sanela Diana Jenkins Human Rights Project</strong></h3><p>The Sanela Diana Jenkins Human Rights Project was launched at the Law School attached to the University of California, Los Angeles, in August 2008.

Comparing the ravaged country’s long-term recovery to that of her home country and Herzegovina, Diana argued that the United States shouldn’t think of withdrawing their assistance from Haiti anytime soon. She also talked about the need for humanitarian assistance, which she deemed to be critical at that stage.</p><p>Diana ended up spending a couple of weeks in Haiti after the earthquake. She was stationed in Port-au-Prince, delivering supplies and aid to the people.</p><h3><strong>Diana Jenkins Has Been in Multiple Fundraising</strong></h3><p>A woman with a heart of gold, Diana Jenkins has been severally involved in raising funds for one charitable course or the other.

The organization draws public attention to the incessant human rights atrocities that were witnessed in Darfur.</p><h3><strong>Diana Jenkins’s Net Worth and New Found Wealth Exposed her to a lot of Controversies</strong></h3><p>Debuting on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reality show, Diana wasted no time in letting her cast members know of her new-found wealth by referring to herself as “nouveau-riche.” Naturally, her character brought out the worst in her housemates and fans alike.</p><p>Soon, fans started labeling her with unpalatable names like “the epitome of money with no class, “the least humble beginning Housewife,” and more. One Reddit user said Diana Jenkins could be the world’s richest, but her attitude will still make her appear cheap.</p><p>Diana was really loudmouthed in RHOBH, she was once called a soulless person by Sutton Stracke, to which she responded, “You need a new villain?
