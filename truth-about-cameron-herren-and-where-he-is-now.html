He was tried for their deaths and is currently serving 24 years prison sentence.</strong></p><p>As we know, fame can come either via positive or negative reasons, and in the case of Cameron Herren, it came through a negative reason. Herren was living the life of a normal American teenager until 2018, when he hit a woman and her baby during street racing. The unfortunate accident ensured that his life would never remain the same again.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Cameron Herren’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Cameron Coyle Herren</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of birth: </b>9th September 1999</li><li><b>Cameron Herren’s Age: </b>24 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>Caucasian</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>American</li><li><b>Zodiac Sign: </b>Virgo</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation: </b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion: </b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Single</li><li><b>Cameron Herren’s Parents:</b> Cheryl and Chris Herren</li><li><b>Siblings:</b> Tristan Herren</li><li><b>Cameron Herren’s Height in Inches: </b>5 feet 6 inches</li><li><b>Cameron Herren’s Height in Centimetres: </b>168 cm</li><li><b>Cameron Herren’s Weight:</b> 52 kg</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>Vehicular homicide</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Cameron Herren?</strong></h2><p>Cameron Herren is 24 years old as of 2023. He was born Cameron Coyle Herren on the 9th day of September 1999 in his home state of Texas, United States of America. Herren was raised by his parents, Chris Herren and Cheryl Herren, alongside his older brother Tristan Herren. His father, Chris, is a filmmaker and editor, while his mother, Cheryl, works as the vice president at State Farm Insurance.</p><p>Herren holds American citizenship by birth and belongs to the Caucasian ethnic group. He attended a local elementary school in Texas and Tampa Catholic High School for his education. After that, he proceeded to the prestigious Texas Tech University, where he pursued his bachelor’s degree.</p><p>During his days in college, Cameron Herren was known for his passion for car racing. This same passion would lead to the accident, which totally changed his life.</p><h2><strong>Cameron Herren’s Story</strong></h2><p>On the 23rd day of May 2018, Cameron Herren, with his brother Tristan as a passenger, was racing one of his pals named, Alexander Barrineau. While this street race was going on, Herren accidentally hit a woman named Jessica Reisinger and her 21-month-old baby, Lillia Reisinger. Jessica, who was pushing her baby daughter in a stroller on the street of Bayshore Boulevard, was trying to cross the street when she observed two cars approaching them at a very high speed.</p><p>To save her baby, she quickly pushed the stroller over to the other part of the road. Unfortunately, the stroller did not go far enough, and Cameron’s Ford Mustang vehicle collided with her and her baby. Jessica <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">died</a> on the spot, while her daughter Lillia died the following day, just three months before her second birthday.</p><p>Cameron Herren was 18 years old at the time of this accident and was arrested alongside his brother and John Barrineau. Several days later, the three appeared in front of a Temple court, and the trial was scheduled for December 2020. The prosecutors argued that Cameron, 18, and his brother Tristan, 20, were racing another motorist John Barrineau, 17, at a speed exceeding 162 mph.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Cameron-Herren-c.jpg><h2><strong>Cameron Herren was Sentenced to a 24-Year Jail Term in April 2021</strong></h2><p>John Barrineau pleaded guilty to unauthorized racing and vehicular murder and reached a plea bargain with the state. He was sentenced to six years of prison and 15 years of supervised release. On his own part, Cameron Herren faced a 30-year jail term and opted for an open plea, leaving his fate in the hands of the court.</p><p>Cameron Herren’s trial took three years, and a decision was passed down by the courts in April 2021. Hillsborough Circuit Judge Christopher Nash found Cameron guilty of two counts of vehicular homicide. He sentenced him to nine years of imprisonment for the first count and 15 years sentence for the second count.</p><p>Although Cameron Herren pleaded for a reduced sentence, the court, unfortunately, upheld 24 years of jail term. The sentence began running in April 2021. Meanwhile, during the sentencing hearing, David Raubenolt, Jessica’s husband and baby Lillia’s father, spoke directly to Cameron Harren and informed the young man that it was critical for him to understand that he had created “everlasting pain and depths of sorrow”.</p><h2><b>His Lengthy Jail Term has Spurned Debates Online&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Cameron Herren’s sentence sparked a serious debate online, whereby many people were of the opinion that his punishment was quite excessive. Even though everyone admitted that the death of Jessica Reisinger and her 21-month-old daughter was tragic and heartbreaking, they still believe that the young man didn’t deserve such enormous punishment.</p><p>Many felt that the fact that Herron was only 18 years old at the time of the ugly incident should have been considered by the courts.&nbsp; A few months following the sentencing hearing, the topic gathered more than 100,000 tweets, predominantly from Middle Eastern Twitter accounts.</p><p>Additionally, on TikTok, an account #justiceforcameron was created, and within a few months, the content posted in it had more than 2.5 billion views and counting.</p><p>Cameron Herren, currently 24 years old, is serving his 24 years jail term, which started counting in April 2021. He is serving his sentence at the Graceville Correctional Institution, a secure governmental prison for men in Graceville, Florida, United States of America.</p><h2><strong>Where is Cameron Herren Now?</strong></h2><p>There have been inquiries about whether Cameron Herren will get parole, but there is no valid answer, as his appeal is still pending. Meanwhile, a Bay Area criminal defense attorney named Bjorn B. Runvand believes that Cameron has a strong case and deserves another chance and leniency.</p><p>Sources also reported that Cameron’s parents are praying and pleading for a term reduction. However, their hopes were dashed in November 2022 as the court formally <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">rejected</a> their son’s application for a reduction in his 24 years sentence.</p><p>Meanwhile, before his arrest, Cameron Harren was alleged to be in a relationship with a woman named Savannah. According to the information gathered, the duo was used to making TikTok videos together and posting them on Cameron’s TikTok page, and they would often get thousands of views. Savannah has, since the incident, assumed a low profile and rejected all interviews from various media outlets and journalists.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Cameron Herren?</strong></h3><p>Cameron Herren is a 24 year-old American convicted felon who made the news for killing a mother and her child during a street race in 2018.
