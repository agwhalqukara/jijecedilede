She has a younger brother named Andrew – he and their parents are still living in Boston where Andrew is studying, while Jessica is living in New York because of her modeling job.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>When she was still little, Jessica took ballet classes, and was also interested in gymnastics. It was her mother who kept encouraging her to try ballet and acting, and when she decided to go into modelling, it was her mom again who was her biggest supporter. She was also home schooled, which is not something common nowadays.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Her first job was with a modeling company called “Newbury Street-based Maggie Inc.”. After working with them for a while, she left to find better agencies in New York, where she is currently signed to Elite Model Management. Other than being a model, you can also call Jessica a YouTuber – she has her own <a rel=nofollow href=#>channel</a> which she opened on 3 September 2011 but wasn’t active until 2015. She uploads videos about make-up, style and clothing, lasting for no more than 15 minutes, and which she films at her home with a Canon 70D camera, a tripod and a ring light, also using her Canon G7X and her iPhone. If you think that you need help with your style, or you want to change your appearance, you can try watching her videos. Jessica has nearly one million subscribers on her channel, and a whopping 44 million views combined of her videos, of the almost 150 on her channel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20319-jessica-clements-feature-1024x683.jpg><p>Jessica has also appeared in a couple of movies although only in minor roles; the short horror film called <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Infested Ship”</a> in 2011, about four friends who break into a ship rumored to be haunted – once aboard they encounter the undead. This short film has 7.2/10 rating on IMDb. After that, she appeared in “The Devil’s Nightmare” in 2012 and “Real Estate” in 2019. “The Devil’s Nightmare” is a horror movie with a rating of 6.8/10 while the “Real Estate” is a short drama film which is yet to be released, about a young man who goes into the real estate business aiming to become a successful businessman. Not a lot of people know that Jessica has also started two companies. One of them is a personal investment company focused on digital technology platforms, while the other is a consultancy agency focused on fashion, advertising, and digital brand development.</p><h2><span id=Jessica_and_her_pet_parrot>Jessica and her pet parrot</span></h2><p>There is this beautiful story about Jessica and her pet parrot Picasso. Her family always had birds in their house. She used to go with them to the pet store to buy food and toys for their birds, and in the store she fell in love with an Amazon parrot. Sadly, when they finally decided to buy him, they found out that somebody had already bought it. Then a few years later, just as in the movies, Picasso found his way to her. The owners of the parrot brought him to Jessica’s parents because they heard her family shelters “problem birds”. Apparently, they didn’t treat him right, and therefore he was kind of disobedient. Well, it was great because he was reunited with Jessica and the two of them became instant friends.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy bird day ? <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/b8SL3HglAz</a></p><p>— Jessica Clements (@jclements43) <a rel=nofollow href=#>January 5, 2017</a></p><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>We know that Jessica was dating <a rel=nofollow href=#>Erik Conover</a> – a YouTube star – from 2012 for four years before they split in 2016. You can see Jessica in a couple of videos on Erik’s YouTube channel. Other than that, there is no more information regarding her love life. Jessica also advised everyone to try and keep their personal life to themselves, in order to avoid rumors and negative influences on their lives.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Jessica is currently 25 years old. She has long brown hair and blue eyes. She is 5ft 10ins (1.78m) tall, weighs around 132lbs (60kg), her vital statistics are 32-24-35. and she wears size nine shoes.</p><p>According to authoritative sources, Jessica’s net worth is estimated to be almost $1 million. Her main sources of income are modelling and YouTube, but she is also making a decent amount from her two companies.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Presence>Social Media Presence</span></h2><p>Jessica is very active on her social media accounts. She first started using Twitter in November, 2011 and has so far tweeted 1,650 times and gathered almost 13,000 followers. She also has an <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a> account with 420 posts, and more than 620,000 followers. You can also find her on Snapchat under the name “jclem43”.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><p>“Whenever I go home, my dad will connect my channel to the television and we’ll have to start watching it, he’ll just go, ‘Look who’s on TV!’”- Jessica Clements People tend to confuse this Jessica with Jessica-Jane Clement who is an English actress and TV presenter, but is also eight years older than our Jessica. She loves to hear stories about how her videos helped and inspired others, knowing how their lives were improved, and thinks that is the most rewarding part of everything she does.</p><p>Her personal favorite project that she’s worked on is her ambassadorship with Chanel Beauty. That has been her dream since she was a little girl, as she loved Coco Chanel. Her advice to everyone is to never lose yourself no matter what you are doing, and to keep your most cherished things to yourself. She stopped drinking coffee not so long ago. Her favorite food is pasta – bolognese and carbonara.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunC2xKyqopuRYrCtscyepa2rXay2rLWMm6CoZZGcsm66xK1ksKeiqbVutMSinqGsXZe8urLRopynnF2ZrrW1zaBm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bird-with-a-great-horned-variety.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bird with a great horned variety">&larr;
