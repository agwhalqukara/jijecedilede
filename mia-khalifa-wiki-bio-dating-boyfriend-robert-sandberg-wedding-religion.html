Mia reached stardom as a pornographic actress, and having grown up in a religious household, her parents stopped talking to her because of her career choice. Mia’s career in the adult film industry was active for only two years, but in due time she became quite popular which enabled her pursuit of other endeavors.</p><p>So, do you want to find out more about Mia Khalifa, from her childhood years to most recent career endeavors, including her personal life as well?

Her parents are Catholics and she was raised as one. The family settled in Montgomery County, Maryland where she went to high school, and experienced bullying, but also played lacrosse, and then entered the Massanutten Military Academy, before studying at the University of Texas at El Paso, from which she acquired a Bachelor of Arts degree in History.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>During her college years, Mia was a bartender, but was also offered modeling work; she did a couple of gigs, and after graduation moved to Miami, where she continued her career and made a step forward by doing nude modeling. Gradually, she was becoming famous, and was approached by a scout with an offer for an adult film. Mia had no doubts about accepting the offer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mia-Khalifa.jpg><h2><span id=Rise_to_Prominence>Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p>Mia soon became a part of the big BangBros production company, with which she signed a contract, and upon the release of one of her many videos achieved world popularity. She was wearing a hijab in one of the videos, which came under fierce criticism from people all around the globe, not only Muslims but even Catholics, with her parents disassociating themselves from Mia and her career choice.

Subsequently, despite signing a new deal with BangBros, Mia decided not to continue through with the contract and <a rel=nofollow href=#>left the pornographic industry</a>, since when she has been focused on modeling work, and has her own page on Patreon through which she sells nude pictures of herself. Furthermore, she has also worked for a short period of time as a bookkeeper and paralegal.</p><h2><span id=YouTube_Career_and_Television_Host>YouTube Career and Television Host</span></h2><p>Mia has started a <a rel=nofollow href=#>YouTube channel</a>, on which she posts videos that showcase her daily life, and has also run a show “Out of Bounds”, next to Gilbert Arenas, as a part of the Complex News YouTube channel, from late 2017 to early 2018.
