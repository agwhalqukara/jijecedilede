According to some reports, she was born in Toronto, the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. This was also where she reportedly grew up with her family. Sage was born on 5th August 1972 and is now 51 years old. This means her zodiac sign is Leo.</p><p>Sage was born to a father called Bill Humphrey and a mother called Barbara Humphrey. Not much is known about what they did for a living in Canada to raise Sage. According to some reports, Sage has a sister whose identity remains quite vague at the moment.</p><p>Having been born and raised in Canada, Sage Robbins is clearly a Canadian citizen. However, she has also become an American citizen. This was facilitated following her marriage to her American husband, Tony Robbins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/sage-robbins1.jpg><h3><strong>Her Real Name at Birth Was Bonnie Pearl Humphrey&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Interestingly, even though everyone now knows her as Sage Robbins, this was not the name she was born with. According to our findings, she was born Bonnie Pearl Humphrey and answered this name up until the time she got married to Tony Robbins.</p><p>When she eventually married Tony, she decided to adopt her husband’s surname and became known as Pearl Robbins. However, she did not stop there for some reason. She also decided to dump her birth name of Pearl and adopted Sage instead. So, she transitioned from Pearl Robbins to Sage Ribbins, and this is what everyone now knows her as.</p><p>According to some reports, Sage Robbins is actually of mixed ethnicity. This is because her father, Bill Humphrey, is reportedly of English and Scottish descent, while her mother, Barbara Humphrey, is of German and Irish descent. So, Sage is said to have English, German, Irish, and Scottish roots.</p><h3><strong>Is Sage Robbins Educated?</strong></h3><p>Sage Robbins is reported to be a well-educated woman. And this is evident in the way she speaks to crowds who listen to her when she gives her motivational speeches. However, the exact details of the kind of education she has had remains vague.</p><p>It is not clear what college she attended as these details have been kept pretty much beyond the reach of the public. Several reports have made different claims about the schools she supposedly attended, However, these claims have not been independently verified. What is clear is that Sage does sound like a really educated woman who knows exactly what she is doing.</p><h3><strong>Sage Robbins Was Previously Married To John Lynch</strong></h3><p>Before meeting and marrying Tony Robbins, Sage Robbins was previously married to a man called John Lynch, a fellow Canadian. The couple got married to each other and exchanged vows in 1992 when Sage was just 19 years old. John was 30 years old at the time. John Lynch was a businessman who was doing very well for himself. It is not clear why Sage decided to marry at such a young age.</p><p>Not much is known about what transpired in their marriage and how they went about showing love to each other. But reports say the couple never had children together while the marriage lasted. At first, everything appeared to be perfect for the couple, but their union ultimately collapsed in 1999.</p><p>The couple then got enmeshed in a messy divorce that was eventually finalized in 2000.</p><h2><strong>How Old Was Sage When She Met Tony?</strong></h2><p>Sage Robbins and Tony Robbins’ paths crossed for the first time in 1999 at one of Tony’s motivational seminars held in Hawaii.

Meanwhile, Tony had recently also gone through a divorce with his ex-wife, Becky Robbins, and was trying to get himself together.</p><p>Shortly after their initial meeting, Sage and Tony developed a strong connection and soon began dating. However, it is not clear exactly when they began their romance. What is clear is their shared interests in personal development, self-improvement, and helping others served as a strong foundation for their budding relationship. As they spent more time together, their bond grew.</p><p>During this period, Sage Robbins and Tony Robbins made headlines in tabloids due to an incident where they were seen kissing.

Lynch dragged Tony to court and alleged that Tony had stolen his ex-wife, Sage, from him. He filed a lawsuit for alienation of affection. Lynch claimed that he first learned about Tony’s involvement with Sage when he saw pictures of them together in a tabloid magazine and that he was still married to Sage then.</p><p>In response to these accusations, Sage Robbins spoke up and firmly denied the claims made by Lynch. She asserted that Lynch’s actions were merely an attempt to gain attention and extort money at the expense of Tony’s reputation. Sage stated that she had never heard of Tony Robbins at the time of her separation from Lynch and emphasized that he played no role in their divorce.</p><p>She went ahead to grant an interview to The Sun and clarified that Tony Robbins had no connection to the breakdown of her previous marriage.&nbsp;However, John Lynch refused to back down and continued to contend that the timing of their separation and Sage’s introduction to Tony Robbins at one of his motivational seminars in Hawaii a year prior raised questions about the nature of their relationship.</p><p>The case went to court. However, the matter is believed to have been settled out of court afterward. John Lynch went on with his life.</p><h2><strong>Sage Robbins Has Been Tony Robbins’s Wife Since 2001</strong></h2><p>In 2001, several months after the controversial court case involving Sage’s ex-husband, John Lynch, she and Tony Robbins became husband and wife.
